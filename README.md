![Frontend](./assets/featured-image.png)

The frontend for my portfolio site is built on React, tailwind, three.js and GSAP.

It's built on the principles of resuable components that are populated with props and all-round reusability and portability from an easily editable data store.

Github Actions takes care of my CI/CD process including deployment to AWS EC2.

There will be a blogs section soon and more CMS-like control in the future.

WIP!
